                Hello! My name is Nora, and I am passionate about web development and creating
                engaging user experiences. I enjoy working with modern technologies like React,
                TypeScript, and more to build scalable and efficient applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I love exploring new coding challenges, learning new skills, and
                contributing to open-source projects. Feel free to connect with me and check out
                my work!
